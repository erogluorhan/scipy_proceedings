The Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: An Open Development, Community Driven Toolkit in the Scientific Python Ecosystem
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

The Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit (GeoCAT) team develops and maintains
data analysis and visualization tools on structured and unstructured grids for
the geosciences community in the Scientific Python Ecosystem (SPE). In response to
dealing with increasing geoscientific data sizes, GeoCAT prioritizes scalability,
ensuring its implementations to be scalable from personal laptops to HPC clusters.
Another major goal of the GeoCAT team is to ensure community involvement throughout
the whole project lifecycle, which is realized through an open development mindset
by encouraging the users/contributors to get involved in any decision-making.

Introduction
------------

The Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit (GeoCAT) team, established in 2019,
leads the software engineering efforts of the National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR) “Pivot to Python” initiative :cite:`pivot19`. The initiative
had an initial two-year roadmap with major milestones being: (1) Replicating
NCL’s computational routines in Python, (2) training and support for
transitioning NCL users into Python, and (3) moving tools into an open development
model. GeoCAT essentially aims at creating scalable data analysis and
visualization tools on structured and unstructured grids for the geosciences
community in the SPE. The GeoCAT team is committed to open development, which
helps the team prioritize community involvement at any level of the project
lifecycle alongside having the whole software stack open-sourced.

GeoCAT created several, now-established, Python tools that are hosted and
managed publicly on GitHub to develop computation and visualization functions,
which  are built on cornerstone Pangeo :cite:`pangeo18` (i.e. a community platform
for big data geoscience) packages such as Xarray :cite:`xarray17`, Dask
:cite:`dask15`, as well as Jupyter Notebooks, and is compatible with Numpy. Dask
compatibility allows the GeoCAT-comp functions to scale from personal laptops to
high performance computing systems such as NCAR’s Casper, Cheyenne, and upcoming
Derecho clusters :cite:`ams22craker`.

Briefly, GeoCAT-comp houses computational operators for applications ranging from
regridding and interpolation, to climatology and meteorology. GeoCAT-examples
provides over 140 publication-quality plotting scripts in Python for Earth
sciences. It also houses Jupyter notebooks with high-performance, interactive
plots that enable features such as pan and zoom on fine-resolution geoscience
data (e.g. ~3 km data rendered within a few tens of seconds to few minutes on
personal laptops). GeoCAT-viz enables higher-level implementation of Matplotlib
and Cartopy plotting capabilities through it's variety of easy to use
visualization convenience functions for GeoCAT-examples. GeoCAT also maintains
WRF-Python (Weather Research and Forecasting), which works with WRF-ARW model
output and provides diagnostic and interpolation routines.

GeoCAT was recently awarded Project Raijin, which is an NSF EarthCube-funded
effort :cite:`raijinaward21`. Its goal is to enhance the open-source analysis
and visualization tool landscape by developing community-owned, sustainable,
scalable tools that facilitate operating on unstructured climate and global
weather data in the SPE. Throughout this three-year project, GeoCAT will work
on the development of data analysis and visualization functions that operate
directly on the native grid as well as establish an active community of
user-contributors.

This paper will provide insights about the GeoCAT's software stack and
current status, team scope and near-term plans, open development methodology,
as well as ways of community involvement.

GeoCAT Software
---------------

The GeoCAT team develops and maintains several open-source software tools. Before
describing those tools, it is vital to explain in detail how the team implements the
continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment (CI/CD) in consistence
for all of those tools.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD)
=================================================================

GeoCAT employs a continuous delivery model, which has been achieved through the use
of a monthly package release cycle on package management systems and package indexes
such as Conda :cite:`conda` and PyPI :cite:`conda`. This model helps the team make
new functions available as soon as they are implemented and address potential errors
quickly. To assist this process, the team utilizes advanced  technologies
throughout GitHub assets to ensure automation, unit testing and code coverage, as
well as licensing and reproducibility. Figure 1 :ref:`fig1badges`, for example,
shows the set of badges displaying the near real-time status of each CI/CD implementation
in the GitHub repository homepage from one of our software tools.

CI build tests of our repositories are implemented and
automated (for pushed commits, pull requests, and daily scheduled execution) via
GitHub Actions workflows :cite:`githubactions`, with the "CI" badge showing if those
workflows are passing or failing. Similarly, the "CONDA-BUILDS" badge shows if the
conda recipe works successfully for the repository. The Python package :cite:`codecov`
"codecov" analyzes the percent of code coverage from unit tests in the repository.
Additionally, the overall results as well as details for each code script can be seen
via the "COVERAGE" badge. Each of our software repositories has a corresponding
documentation page that is populated mostly-automatically through the Sphinx Python
documentation generator :cite:`sphinx` and published through ReadTheDocs :cite:`readthedocs`
via an automated building/versioning schema. The "DOCS" badge provides a link to the documentation
page along with showing failures, if any, with the documentation rendering process. Figure 2
:ref:`fig2rtd` shows the documentation homepage of GeoCAT-comp. The "NCAR" and "PYPI" badges
in the "Package" row shows and links to the latest versions of the software tool distributed
through NCAR's Conda channel and PyPI, respectively. The "LICENSE" badge provides a link to our
software licenses, Apache License version 2.0, for all of the GeoCAT stack, enabling the
redistribution of the open-source software products on an "AS IS" basis. Finally, to provide
reproducibility of our software products (either for the latest or any older version), we publish
version-specific Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), which can be accessed through the
"DOI" badge. This allows the end-user to accurately cite the specific version of the
GeoCAT tools they used for scientific/research purposes.

GeoCAT-comp (and GeoCAT-f2py)
=============================

GeoCAT-comp is the computational component of the GeoCAT project as can be seen in
Figure 3 :ref:`fig3structure`. GeoCAT-comp houses implementations of geoscience data
analysis functions. Novel research and development is conducted for analyzing both
structured and unstructured grid data from various research fields such as climate,
weather, atmosphere, ocean, among others. In addition, some of the functionalities of
GeoCAT-comp are inspired or reimplemented from the NCAR Command Language (NCL).

Spherical harmonics (both decomposition and recomposition as well as area
weighting); Fourier transforms such as band-block, band-pass, low-pass, and
high-pass; meteorological variables such as relative humidity, dewpoint temperature,
heat index, saturation vapure pressure, etc.; climatology functions such as climate
average over multiple years, daily/monthly/seasonal averages, as well as anomalies;
regridding of curvilinear grid to rectilinear grid, unstructured grid to rectilinear
grid, curvilinear grid to unstructured grid, and vice versa; interpolation methods
such as bilinear interpolation of a rectilinear to another rectilinear grid,
hybrid-sigma levels to isobaric levels, and sigma to hybrid coordinates; empirical
orthogonal function (EOF) analysis; are some of the functions that are made
available through GeoCAT-comp. GeoCAT-comp documentation :cite:`geocatcomprtd`
provides signatures and descriptions of these functions as well as a line to the
usage examples.

   :cite:`geocatcontribguide` :label:`fig3structure`

Many of the computational functions in GeoCAT are implemented in pure Python.
However, there are some others that are implemented in Fortran but wrapped up
in Python. To facilitate contribution, the whole GeoCAT-comp structure is split
into two repositories with respect to being either pure-Python or Python with
compiled codes (i.e. Fortran) implementations. Such implementation layers are
handled within GeoCAT-comp and GeoCAT-f2py repositories, respectively.

GeoCAT-comp code-base does not explicitly contain or require any compiled
code, making it more accessible to the general Python community at large.
In addition, GeoCAT-f2py is automatically installed through GeoCAT-comp
installation, and all functions contained in the "geocat.f2py" package are
imported transparently into the "geocat.comp" namespace. Thus, GeoCAT-comp
serves as a user API to access the entire computational toolkit even though
its GitHub repository itself only contains pure Python code from the
developer’s perspective. Whenever prospective contributors want to add new
computational functionality implemented as pure Python, GeoCAT-comp is the
GitHub repository to deal with. Therefore, there is no onus on contributors
of pure Python code to build/compile/test any compiled code (i.e. Fortran)
at GeoCAT-comp level.

GeoCAT-examples (and GeoCAT-viz)
================================

GeoCAT-examples :cite:`geocatexamplesrepo` was created to address a few of
the original milestones of NCAR's "Pivot to Python" initiative: (1) to
provide the geoscience community with well-documented visualization examples
for several plotting classes in the SPE, (2) to help transition NCL users
into the Python ecosystem through providing such resources. GeoCAT-examples was
born in early 2020 as the result of a multi-day hackathon event among the GeoCAT
team and several other scientists and developers from various NCAR labs/groups.
It has since grown to house novel visualization examples as well as showcase
the capabilities of other GeoCAT initiatives, like GeoCAT-comp, along with
newer technologies like interactive plotting notebooks. Figure 4
:ref:`fig4cmap` illustrates one of the unique GeoCAT-examples cases that
was aimed at exploring the best practices for data visualization
like choosing color blind friendly colormaps.

   colormap; GeoCAT-examples aiming at choosing color blind friendly
   colormaps :cite:`ams22sizemore` :label:`fig4cmap`

The GeoCAT-examples :cite:`geocatexamplesrtd` gallery contains over 140
example Python plotting scripts, demonstrating functionalities from Python
packages like Matplotlib, Cartopy, Numpy, and Xarray. The gallery includes
plots from a range of visualization categories such as box plots, contours,
meteograms, overlays, projections, shapefiles, streamlines, and trajectories
among others. In addition, GeoCAT-examples houses plotting examples for
individual GeoCAT-comp analysis functions.

Despite the capabilities of Matplotlib and Cartopy to reproduce almost all
of NCL plots, there was one significant caveat with using their low-level
implementations against NCL: NCL's high-level plotting functions allowed
scientists to plot most of the cases in only tens of lines of codes
(LOC) while the Matplotlib and Cartopy stack required writing a few
hundred LOC. In order to build a higher-level implementation on top of
Matplotlib and Cartopy while recreating the NCL-like plots (from vital
plotting capabilities that were not readily available in the Python
ecosystem at the time such as Taylor diagrams and curly vectors to more
cosmetic or plotting style-related effects such as font sizes, color
schemes, etc.), the GeoCAT-viz library :cite:`geocatvizrepo` was
implemented. Use of functions from this library in GeoCAT-examples
significantly reduces the LOC requirements for most of the visualization
examples to comparable numbers to those of NCL's. Figure 5 :ref:`fig5viz`
shows Taylor diagram and curly vector examples that were made available
with the recent implementations in GeoCAT-viz.

   GeoCAT-viz v2022.05.0 :label:`fig5viz`

WRF-Python
==========

WRF-Python was created in early 2017 in order to replicate NCL's Weather
Research and Forecasting (WRF) package in the SPE. About two years later,
NCAR's “Pivot to Python” initiative was announced, and the GeoCAT team
has taken over development and maintenance of WRF-Python.

The package focuses on creating a Python package that eliminates the need
to work across multiple software platforms when using WRF datasets. It
contains more than 30 computational (e.g. diagnostic calculations, several
interpolation routines) and visualization routines that aim at reducing
the amount of post-processing tools necessary to visualize WRF output
files.

Even though there is no continuous development in WRF-Python, as is seen in
the rest of the GeoCAT stack, the package is still maintained strongly
with timely responses and bug-fix releases to the issues reported by the
user community.

Project Raijin
--------------

“Collaborative Research: EarthCube Capabilities: Raijin: Community Geoscience
Analysis Tools for Unstructured Mesh Data”, i.e. Project Raijin, of the
consortium between NCAR and Pennsylvania State University has been awarded by
NSF 21-515 EarthCube for an award period of 1 September, 2021 - 31 August,
2024 :cite:`raijinaward21`. Project Raijin aims at developing community-owned,
sustainable, scalable tools that facilitate operating on unstructured climate
and global weather data :cite:`raijin`. The GeoCAT team is in charge of the
software development of Project Raijin, which mainly consists of implementing
visualization and analysis functions in the SPE to be executed on native
grids. While doing so, GeoCAT is also responsible of establishing an open
development environment, clearly documenting the implementation work, and
aligning the deployments with the project milestones as well as SPE
requirements and specifications.

To realize the aforementioned functionalities, GeoCAT created the
Xarray-based Uxarray package :cite:`uxarrayrepo` to recognize unstructured
grid models through partnership with geoscience community groups. UXarray
is built on top of the built-in Xarray Dataset functionalities while
recognizing several unstructured grid formats (UGRID, SCRIP, and Exodus for now).
Since there are more unstructured mesh models in the community than UXarray
natively supports, its architecture will also support addition of new models.
Figure 6 :ref:`fig6raijin` shows the regularly structured “latitude-longitude”
grids versus a few unstructured grid models.

.. figure:: figures/fig6_raijin.png
   :scale: 20%
   :figclass: bht

   Regular grid (left) vs MPAS-A & CAM-SE grids :label:`fig6raijin`

The UXarray project has implemented data input/output functions for UGRID,
SCRIP, and Exodus, as well as methods for surface area and integration
calculations so far. The team is currently conducting open discussions
(through GitHub Discussions) with community members, who are interested
in unstructured grids research and development, in order to prioritize
data analysis operators to be implemented throughout the project lifecycle.

Open Development
----------------

To ensure community involvement at every level in the development lifecycle,
GeoCAT is committed to an open development model. With this model, we not only
have our project stack open-sourced but also ensure most of the project assets
that are directly related to the software development lifecycle are publicly
accessible. In order to implement this model, GeoCAT provides all of its software
tools as GitHub repositories with public GitHub project boards and roadmaps,
issue tracking and development reviewing, comprehensive documentation for
users/contributors such as Contributor’s Guide :cite:`geocatcontribguide` and
toolkit-specific documentation, along with community announcements on the GeoCAT
blog. Furthermore, GeoCAT encourages community feedback and contribution at any
level with inclusive and welcoming language. As a result of this, community
requests and feedback has played a significant role in forming and revising the
GeoCAT roadmap and projects' scope. We are hoping to increase the community
involvement in our development lifecycle.

Community engagement
--------------------

To further promote engagement with the geoscience community, GeoCAT organizes
and attends various community events.

The GeoCAT team has also encouraged undergraduate and graduate student
engagement in the Python ecosystem through participation in NCAR's Summer
Internships in Parallel Computational Science (SIParCS). GeoCAT-examples and
GeoCAT-viz has received significant contributions through NCAR's Summer
Internships in Parallel Computational Science (SIParCS) in 2020 and 2021
summers.

Project Pythia
==============

The GeoCAT effort is also a part of the NSF funded Project Pythia. Project
Pythia aims to provide a public, web-accessible training resource that could
help educate earth scientists to more effectively use the SPE and cloud
computing for dealing with big data in geosciences. GeoCAT helps with Pythia
development through content creation and infrastructure contributions.

GeoCAT has also contributed several Python tutorials to the educational resources
created through Project Pythia.
